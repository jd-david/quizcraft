# QuizCraft

QuizCraft is a mobile application built with Flutter for the frontend and a Node.js backend. It's designed as a mini-project for a CS degree, showcasing a full-stack application with Firebase integration.

## üìú Description

QuizCraft is a mobile application that helps students study by converting lecture materials into interactive quizzes. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze uploaded text and automatically generate questions that test understanding.

Effective learning from lecture materials often extends beyond passive reading and note-taking. Students frequently face challenges in actively engaging with content, identifying key concepts for self-assessment, and efficiently preparing for examinations. Traditional study methods, while valuable, can be time-consuming and may not always facilitate the proven benefits of active recall and self-testing. While digital study tools exist, there's a distinct need for a mobile-first solution that seamlessly transforms personal lecture materials into customized learning aids, empowering students to study smarter, not just harder.
