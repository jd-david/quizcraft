## INTRODUCTION

Effective learning from lecture materials often extends beyond passive reading and note-taking. Students frequently face challenges in actively engaging with content, identifying key concepts for self-assessment, and efficiently preparing for examinations. Traditional study methods, while valuable, can be time-consuming and may not always facilitate the proven benefits of active recall and self-testing. While digital study tools exist, there's a distinct need for a mobile-first solution that seamlessly transforms personal lecture materials into customized learning aids, empowering students to study smarter, not just harder.

## OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to develop a mobile application that empowers students to automatically generate study questions directly from their lecture materials to enhance their learning process.

---

## METHODOLOGY

This project involves the development of a mobile application with the following core workflow:

*   **Material Input:** Users upload lecture materials (e.g., PDF, TXT files) or paste text directly into the application.
*   **Text Processing & Analysis:** The app utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to parse the input text, identify key concepts, important terms, and relevant sentences.
*   **Question Generation:** Based on the analyzed text, intelligent algorithms formulate various types of study questions (e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, short answer) designed to test comprehension.
*   **Interactive Interface:** A user-friendly mobile interface allows students to easily manage materials, initiate question generation, take quizzes, and review their answers.

## RESULTS

*   **Quiz Craft:** Functional mobile app prototype developed.
*   **Core Input:** Lecture materials via [text, PDF, image] successfully processed.
*   **Question Generation:** Demonstrably creates [multiple-choice, open-ended, etc.] questions.
*   **Performance:** Initial tests: avg. [30 sec/600 words/page] generation time.
